# MC2_app
Steps to make the app work:

1. Open Android studio

2. 
  
  If you're opening android studio for the first time 
    
    - Click on "Get from VCS" (DO NOT create a New Project!)
    
    - Select Git as your version control and paste this link in the URL field -- "https://github.com/mcproject24/MC2_app.git"
    
    - Click on "Clone" to clone the project from this repo
  
  If you already have opened android studio and by default a project opens
    
    - Click on File on the top left
    
    - Select New --> Project from Version Control
    
    - Select Git as your version control and paste this link in the URL field -- "https://github.com/mcproject24/MC2_app.git"
    
    - Click on "Clone" to clone the project from this repo

3. Tether the USB cable to the laptop and the phone and then hit on Run (you have to enable USB debugging in the first place in your phone). If this doesnt work use Pair devices using Wi-Fi to connect your phone. If you find it hard still, see a yt tutorial to connect the phone to android studio and run the app.

4. The app will work now.
